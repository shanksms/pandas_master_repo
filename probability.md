## Counting
### choose with without ordering
$\binom{n}{k}$

## Probability
### Sample space
A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiments
### Event
An event is a subset of a sample space

### Naive definition of Probability
P(A) = # favorable outcomes / # positive outcomes
P(A) - is the probability of event A which is favorable outcomes  
Assumptions:  
1. All the outcomes are equally likely  
2. Finite sample space  

Remember that you need strong justification to use naive definition of probability.
