## Counting
### choose  without ordering
Imagine you have to choose k people out n. In this case order does not matter. Below formulae can be used:  
![\Large \binom{n}{k}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\binom{n}{k})   
It is pronounced as n choose k. It is written as following as fractions:    
![\Large \frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\frac{!n}{p!(n-p)!}) 
### Choose with ordering
Imagine you have n letters and you have to choose k letter. In this case ordering does matter (AB is different from BA)      
![\Large \frac{n!}{(n-p)!}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\frac{!n}{(n-p)!}) 

### replacement and ordering
Lets say we have n objects and we have to choose k:  
with replacement, order does not matter:  
![\Large ^{nk}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;^{nk}) 

## Probability
### Sample space
A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiments
### Event
An event is a subset of a sample space

### Naive definition of Probability
P(A) = # favorable outcomes / # positive outcomes
P(A) - is the probability of event A which is favorable outcomes  
Assumptions:  
1. All the outcomes are equally likely  
2. Finite sample space  

Remember that you need strong justification to use naive definition of probability.
