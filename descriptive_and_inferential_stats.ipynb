        "What comes to mind when you hear the word “statistics”? Is it calculating mean, median, mode, charts, bell curves, and other tools to describe data? This is the most commonly understood part of statistics, called descriptive statistics, and we use it to summarize data. After all, is it more meaningful to scroll through a million records of data or have it summarized? We will cover this area of statistics first.\n",

Often we are interested in studying a group that is too large to observe (e.g., average height of adolescents in North America) and we have to resort to using only a few members of that group to infer conclusions about them. As you can guess, this is not easy to get right. After all, we are trying to represent a population with a sample that may not be representative. We will explore these caveats along the way."
