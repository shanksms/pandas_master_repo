##Linear regression
A regression attempts to fit a function to observed data. this function can be used to make prediction on new data.  
A linear regression fits a straight line to observed data. This tries to show linear relationship between two variables.  
This line can be used to make prediction on new data.  
I want to study the relationship between the age of a dog and the number of veterinary visits it had. In a fabricated    
sample we have 10 random dogs. I am a fan of understanding complex techniques with simple datasets (real or otherwise),  
so we understand the strengths and limitations of the technique without complex data muddying the water. Letâ€™s plot this dataset.

We can clearly see there is a linear correlation here, meaning when one of these variables increases/decreases, the other  
increases/decreases in a roughly proportional amount. We could draw a line through these points to show a correlation.
